        <p>
A course creates an implicit contract between teachers and students: the teacher must have deep knowledge of the subject, present it in a clear and engaging manner, and provide exercises that test students and develop their knowledge. If students commit the necessary time and effort, they should expect to gain a solid understanding of the topic by the end of the course. To ensure this outcome, I use active classroom formats, emphasize real-world perspective, and provide diverse learning resources.
</p>
<p>
Consensus has begun to develop that lectures without direct student participation are not ideal for learning, so I provide frequent opportunities to apply course material in class. I am currently co-teaching a Machine Learning class in Googleâ€™s TechExchange program for undergraduate juniors from underrepresented groups. Class meetings are split between lecturing, coding demonstrations, and group discussions where students try to figure out concepts before they are presented. This variety drives student engagement and provides an immediate signal as to how the class as a whole is understanding the material. As a TA at Columbia, I helped implement a "flipped classroom" format where in-class time was devoted solely to hands-on lab exercises and students were expected to watch recorded lectures on their own time. This approach is particularly beneficial in STEM classes where many practical questions arise when applying the theory learned in lectures.
</p>
<p>
To further engage students in the material, I create connections to real-world applications in industry and academic research. I found that there were no classes at Columbia that taught Python for scientific computing, so I organized a lecture series covering useful and little-known aspects of the language. The lectures were recorded and posted on YouTube where many have been viewed thousands of times. I also created the Hacking in Audio and Music Research (HAMR) series which applies the startup hackathon model to research problems, with 12 hackathons held to date. Many projects started at a HAMR have subsequently been published. Finally, in my teaching, I have students produce a final project on a subject of their choosing which is written up as a mock research paper. This assignment provides direct experience with the process of planning a research project and writing up the results for publication.
</p>
<p>
Even with engaging lectures and real-world motivation, some students may struggle to grasp the material. A well-written textbook can be helpful to fill in these gaps, but course content is often not completely covered by a textbook and students may have learning difficulties that are hard to anticipate in advance. Apart from ensuring that my course-specific notes are comprehensive and available to students, I also create additional material on-the-fly as needed. For example, in the Machine Learning course I am co-teaching, I found that students were having difficulty understanding the mechanics of TensorFlow, so I created a "TensorFlow Basics" tutorial tailored to the course content.
</p>
<p>
Outside of the classroom, mentorship is an important part of being an effective researcher and teacher. I hosted interns in my lab during my Ph.D. and have mentored residents and interns while at Google. These collaborations have culminated in conference publications, open-source software projects, and conversion to full-time positions and graduate school. The varying experience levels of my mentees has taught me to serve many roles - from a source of expertise and guidance to a more active collaborator. A Google resident mentee recently wrote that:
</p>
<p class="quote">
Colin is an excellent mentor, with a good understanding of the topics he's helping on at every level -- from high-level planning and research, down to the minutiae of finding bugs in the code. He keeps projects organized, is available for questions and conversations whenever needed, and is extremely pleasant to be around.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, in my teaching and mentorship I strive to tailor my work to the needs of learners, to creatively address gaps in the material, and to make myself available as a source of expertise and real-world perspective.  This enables me to fulfill the teacher-student contract, giving students a strong base of knowledge to apply to their future careers.
